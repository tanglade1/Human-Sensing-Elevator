# Human-Sensing-Elevator
This project was the final design for the Microcontrollers class at Valencia College. A flexible concept, the elevator uses IR sensors to detect the presence of a person, then, a signal is sent to a stepper motor to rotate clockwise or counter clockwise with respect to the floor itâ€™s been activated at.
